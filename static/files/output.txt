good.
my T. P. T.  working on pro bono basis so they have joy they are being a part of a duty to  from the time of the season they are being led by difficult of one difficult.
.
 I think.
because internet is bad  I introduced a team  to  enter shot  along with  we have to order the colleagues the brick  is needing the team  we have another question which is what number did on its aspect of the.
and once you.
so this is a tag team and  C. O. has joined so would you like to take us to the entire as a P. presentations up.
yes yes  that morning said  we have been working on long as we have discussed in the meeting that was in the second key and  also and  premises office you said like the national program on artificial intelligence the cabinet was prepared after the subject was handed over to  Macy and .
with the initial things been done many yeah you can we have a safety.
I guess I don't know what it was like did you want to go to a team that matches started doing this by the P. I owe and then maybe I will go what an EFC approval but implementation of the last few in the eye you know goes to the nineteenth and see if you would be able to cope with it but  seven PM.
thank.
a discussion came in making or so back to this issue with that actually implementation of III should come under the domain name is sure to produce an AC and they after they were like us D. ease of meeting just almost a year and a D. and  I'm following up by me P. general it's going to get by that  in order with that the cabinets north would be Sierra five me see so.
and then the doctor ordered our technology group and the P. S. C. approved active Dr Avenue.
D..
so that it doesn't even well what what.
what are you.
yes this.
legislative issue yeah so so this is  the horn of plenty when federal over and back and forth so Silverlight rations of the cabinet note and in the meantime my department assigned technology and also what that will for the technology division Hobbs because it I know what is happening with the order though for the research part of our company no and then the meetings  office autumn was looking after the subject at that point of thanks to a series of meeting the prime minister's office also and then the direction was given that first we need to come up with a deductible and scream well and dad after we should be doing that a I know so we started working on the vehicle and it's been bought the property she was published in  February twenty twenty two and then it went through it on the public discussions then there regarding put some honorable minister and I'm with and often Bain carpeting all the feedback is received a report.
the input that we received from under minimum wage and unable to Mr though  dropped the file has been approved  yesterday when you sent me what the file back but today we are going to publish that rocked the women's  doctor golden's been locally see what two weeks of public consultations on our website so that is the worst it doesn't mean time when we had a discussion with the ones that also when we identified that if we are not able to get seven thousand five hundred but also the note should we not try to get in the same seat in a stock on some components on this of C. and later on see if we need more funds that we have lost almost forty years in this whole process so that this will be like you like how we have come around from the national strategy on the eye to the doctor to see note at this stage and I would just be explain what we're the company that means literally goat and which of those are not being made included as part of this email next.
next slide please.
who is it yeah.
okay so this is a key component of C. note  in the you don't have that flight bill in which we did real quick we are doing now and deal with that being covered by other projects.
yes so this was the old all and be a object is a national program on the A. objective the usually the whole cabinet don't have.
six major components no one wants to have the system they've got it up management office that you're proposing the other was focusing on the ice killing then the other one the the tardy keep keep the letter which was done two weeks I used was set up in your name Indians or recently I believe lastly I applications are to be picking up the I. projects in the I. implementation were taken up through this  it hi this is a third company that was there in the cabinet gold and do the other components like building up of A. I. infrastructure in the form of an I. what the supercomputer I see that before that  some provision was made in the cabinet nope but then also  we have approved up you'll see what feedback to start building it and I'm not but two hundred and forty eight but I know that that would be a blue it was felt that since it's been already approved project that probably could be scaled up and we can I would go from there it's just a note for the building of the A. I. infrastructure number financing ticket isn't it right that we should not have multiple  multiple scheme to multiple projects for funding I hope you've maybe start up I was picking up on me go for technology stocks than even a I just happened to be provided funding to any esteem somebody used to that message only so I'm with this financing Oakley I also was not was kind of taken off from this if you know and the third important the.
but  component about that he said  which  the quotes are put up in fact in the late afternoon no  the what exactly the I. since that they cannot you know we should have it already been approved as part of the national mission on  because systems but about the guardian already twenty five P. eight seven anyway approved and  I don't implementation this is also taking off so now what we have done is that we have a did you open P. eighty two or leader  the items on the left which  which would bring down the cost within five minutes old and we also reduce the time needed to implementation of this project from five years let's see SO that we come within five hundred throws from  a limited implementation of what was in regards to your next.
this is the key component dependent built up in the S. F. C. note comprises of the indebted out management office which is again a part of the policy that has been  kind of finalized on the policy it should include setting up of the idea more done center level and then data management units in all in fifty ministries but which will provide support for two years through  to data centers and wanted analyst this kind of.
because in in the side with the like .
M. A. T. I'm separate data management units across the street and this data management office will be providing all the support for the.
yes.
.
and we're calling in west may come in anytime that they would call us when he comes out of the meeting that even before since yesterday.
so they need to look into that and I think that management of the implementation of the government's policy as also building capacities and insuring that ordered  departments for the recalls animation standard standard the privacy if they need them in the position because of this of this and that will be added over the data management office the second part is that we are calling the center would be able to tell him back because  that's scaled down version of the.
the end of the  the other project we had proposed setting up often we really got instead of stepping up to really  we are proposing to set up a centre for English social impact what it will do is that will take up a I. solutions in all domains which will be you and some of it will come from the P. I. S. which opens up by  D. S. T. across the government intrusions whatever solution they are developing or what it was solutions industry is developing or if there are any societal challenges for which this year you will call.
I just want to confirm the payment less I think I thought it    well I mean that in place in the  yet.
I think the name  probably  we can  to call for complain because this case for sending back so it gives the impression that that we are working in the only income is the stick   the mail may I point out that the objective because the the idea is to  do  do you work  focused on A. I. in our domain.
impact that name probably is not really  kind of in that meeting so maybe we can  demand this has been settled D. I. R. I'm from misspelling backup I'm such a name so that if that becomes the new and not  give the impression that the only social demand they will work with something like that.
we can do that.
yeah it was a new incentive watch and   actually I we can actually continue with that name on the India and Indians and.
Hey somebody's in the lobby I bought optimistically impact upon the name you can give.
this is a domain that they speak  intent that I'm in that  contorted hundred personally so we can do that we can  we can go.
what are we going to team are you order it and then the other would skilling help if you go to the website to work out like how we would be getting the  people at the last minute so apart from the high yet because I. if he's not letting people but really you know a lot of other people will be trying to backdate  reviews and all so how can we transform over eighty eight I think in trying to build up in the eighty nine follow up and  create employment and  and  in the past you could you go so and the phone number of our responsibility I how do you promote a second allotment of  taking forever how do we ensure that it is insured there also be a proposed a team which will be looking into that responsibility I think  of this program next.
so the internet about your office as I mentioned.
look I need to speed it up a little he even if he were to E. S. and they will the  these are all sorts of different output management office then  I will insurance or date back  the women's diets SO peas processes documentation on all of it forty dollars it's an already done but I. B. M. all the CS I your controversially I will build up in high impact solutions is giving up across India right now the V. you know I lex in the eye but we don't see any scaled up solution but the center will have been yeah  I am back in being back that can be like scaled up I need to also build up in the fall.
really I application and put it as  as in all what do you do all the state department to any state want to adopt and implement it on what they can do that also then for stealing some of your medical you know killing over one hundred fifty thousand trainees what a I needed a job and upscaling of government employees so that's again another output and  responsibility I park will be the one thing was for deployment of A. I. next.
thanks.
so that would be covered with other mentions that it will have to do them and then  at least in one sentence to support fifteen minutes either crossing the street and the B. M. O. R. P. M. U. S. Barker I DMO will work for  the functions will be to ensure that our governments to N. B. C. implementation related with this policy what about animation I need to find the I value reductase well I received the receipts and ensure that the use of data as also building data caps being with this ministry so building will be a big part with that will be assigned to A. DMO.
next.
and the other day when you're actually in each ministry delivered it up a little like to do that and this and wanted to do that listen one.
was work will be to provide  provided support to the cheese get often every ministry right now that we have to get over this but they don't have a backup support to this team of three people the list what is there to provide initial support and we expect that what if needed or  yeah you set it up and those would be up to stopping the ministry and the because she was stocking using  we'll put that expanded.
we'll be able to do that and that what that yeah so so that so what I do have  initially into reading it and later I expecting that each ministry takes up the top of your data management and data governance within you still mean on its own thanks.
and these are the center of our confirmation Lee I had mentioned next still.
the background is it's only been operable the CSA and  John the past the.
we'll be pissed you left in the area solutions are the last eleven so this is again that I've already explained so the fastest two built in the isolation that number to provide nationally.
so the objectives have engines are we invite you writing quite the prior to use gets it and as you mentioned said we'll we'll expand the packet from social impact  or on   other fees also like manufacturing or any of that   any other domain that might be required so that the school will be white I will be able to paste in different  projects and work on top of racially I would also what what do you think that it was still only a solutions we get rid of it but my friend just be back in partnership with US auto by a a by a P. A. S. and we'll double major go off to oversee this will be to not delete it to one of the service but I think the fight scalable solutions and handling the department I'm state government what actually the prime solution and for that using machine learning to improve them backwards if you will that the center will  will  will the.
and it will provide funding support these projects I need to work on  partnership more laid back when he would come from this department and five hunting with the provided through this project next.
so this is the the hallway to function that this just goes into this that you know so yes I will be the primary forty which will be dead which would work with states when you see the technology division help I need to also identify solutions which I've already been double up and then it would also  look into problem privatization for example if you're helping us she's wanting to develop a solution but I can.
that can become the problem statement is only open to stock up sort industry ought to  A. I. any such as and if they come with us  the definitions of corporate type up you'll see that a pilot will be done and if I just look at scaling up will be done and finally impact assessment will be done this whole  process is going to be fine and what we have  what vehicle was it that at the radio stages at the prototype stage and  pilot stage I'm for scaling up funding support will be provided for the support we can propose is  this it is like and   scaling up the approval was almost going to be good what's what you solution for  and the pilot's seat on twenty five lacks  images D. D. Patterson with you will provide lax for the or a new one showing as a pilot and five P.  she's  we plan to do but we do also we have made a finding a location so that's the whole model that be a better water  for the implementation of the center for  confirmation Lee I ought in when you're still means that hasn't proposed.
next.
the card companies of course killing but they're not getting gas and there was just a report with you that you like we need to.
 we need to have cleaned  manpower but leading A. I. in India providing that used to be like a kind of a pretty strong country when it comes to developing or  a ibis allusions but in order to build a lot of skill application of projects we would get for that but if you ever use actually used for detecting the.
and detecting say  or if we ever use you made years off  I used to take it back then hospitals will need people to that would be the images and to show that    based on which a machine learning model can be made so that every Lotto was required for the dental patient a need for  for   doing very basic job which really helped me to  maybe get W. seven four eight applications who said that why do we need to focus on building skills for but I think Gordon for developing a algorithm and the same thing the largest number of jobs will be it will be low value dropping the I. but better than what  I. T. A. in part because we got your schedule right now as mechanics separatists so we real cool to work with I. T. A.'s in order to connect to impart these is to a large number of people in there these days so that we are able to bring the big based off of data that can be used by it is attested by fax us the bill  solutions and just give them up this is the this is the only  up to date has been asked so many fort withstand that gives a better than dimana one thousand people skilled in that but I feel that because of the number of people who can be employed in the shift is much higher and if you just into waiting and provided you speaking prestigious support to I. T. H. what if needed or they will be able to insure that we get a steam supply    people are skilled in that I'm not Asian who can let him go up on the ladder and become more skilled local for handling data and what building solutions next.
so so what we are outside invited to the gaps in their existing ecosystem you like  there are certain things that are that are already being a teller thanks what is your vision C. B. S. E. N..
team responsible for this program but higher education the gap of your speaking team what technology what was with a friend was team but government officials also the suggested frame is that what the real guy happened that the technicians  would I be able to speak with the doctor wouldn't be can transform them into into producing people give them data thanks was given  in  get out in handling data and we didn't want to do today I was supposed to be a part of you trying to get this done after the limited funding support that you're proposing this and we were transformed or techniques I don't know to pick up stealing of government officials indicated that so  and it's killing me so that they can only be used to what buckets and we are not focusing on I A. P. user fees are already starting to my other team to miss your higher education administrator.
E. next.
is that what we have proposed is active we will probably will be set up to fifty eight thirty last across India in the  primarily in the polytechnics and then I. T. age I'm bi said it does work with any what experience I'm really I will be able to paint fifteen thousand students annually across these two will be sent to I mean C. S. will be able to provide  training support two hundred fifty thousand students I'm for this what you think of the I. lab your proposal finding support and five lack what aid gave for today and we'll be working really closely with department of scandal opener on the ship and the state government in ensuring that they are able to augment what you're providing the second property a lapse in providing manpower what insuring running all these laps this is what  have been proposed and  and  and  because as of next.
but government officials the agency we are working with a lot of money is your technology policy and I'll go out and you'll be T. to create content to which we can train  government  because we also had a meeting with  mostly at least it looks not well we have already set up or did you died lapse in partnership with us yeah  waiting .
the proposal and you do that you could think that that  property tax lab and last week said there was a meeting with the academy and we did it they do make it  us our team will still I mean which now they are going to give us more space  was only a teenager spreadsheet but now they're giving me the entire library and you want to build that into what  what all did you get X. P. L. center so we have made a proposal to put a proposal for the mostly at B. but which will get funding from  either A. T. or T. O. P. P. but that's that that's an old man just any program so the school opened this program what we have done it that day  what with the apartment building up any content which will be listed on I got and some butterfly city programs will be organized to ensure that we are able to present  government officials senior living in a artificial intelligence and machine learning I.
in the next three years next.
so that this is the approach of cleanings if you like we were on board meeting  with and we'll work with I'll be left nine eighty eight I really enjoy the training of the mental process to ensure that the longer people I paint across the US next.
and then you put it really I is well known center do you like it L. A. act how do we ensure that whatever is done in the active conforms to the regular three to the responsibility I pretty well  do believe regularly Kappa speak to ensure that enforcement is there although we insure that  that  anyone with him regarding a isolation is doing a basic cleaning responsible A. I. and how do we kind of remote though  researching this one's really I. and ensure that what what was on.
so that eighty anyone who's developing an admonition is able to to build a solution with the sandwich and a pickle otherwise in India the linguistic and  and  I want to be that we have that at least you can get reinforced with the I. solutions and we don't want that to happen so whether to  whether it's with the oculus and emotions I would be able to knock you started it we are the B. B. E. because  with existing data how do we ensure that we are able to I know for instance when you're developing a solution and we do not kind of lose anything which is they don't need to A. D. group of people out Inc I  does not conform to the  the the sequence was a take on the responsibility act this is the one  up to four weeks  see the  honestly I will be created and  next please.
and  the doctor will be given to this  Google will be to to double up that is providing free about you what can go wrong how do we ensure that that we are  yes we are insulated from those  obvious mistakes which most many I. companies have done in the past in the west and we don't end up doing something similar although this year did you say I was going to slide past I'll be from my pay any search how do we build and how do you promote please repeat after building how do we ensure that everybody understands what it meant to me but this one's really I and then how do we have a pretty vocal monitoring the application of this building so that it knowingly or any network you're not doing anything which is not right but  if you can possibly I Sanders thanks.
so so how it will be done he said we'll have occurred with you explore some responsible adding him log in sync with the seventy people maybe I don't get published on the sponsor will act and it'll be you.
what an expert on this one's really I will double up the stack you know what's right and the  remote that I require and then to support them that will be like  like  group which will help with  support once but the committee on exports in developing the same work and the beat I'm medical division that the  sitting up well  within  within  it scope of this project will and she will  kind of  dog actually insure that data that is being used is used to properly at the end after the late don't like lines and Sanders and then there will be for domain specially for example there might be a need for setting up was it because the committee we do have some experts from the health domain will be part of that stuff so I can get you over an email with S. A. P. because I've committee that will be required that's the whole mechanism that you're proposing the sixty more next.
is that these are the reason I would come to responsible A. I. again you like  you already mentioned you like    and  yes this is in fact doctors and by and I'll come back we will be able to   with this S. S. C. note it will help in  social transformation it will help us take projects in the key sector in the eye it will help develop some solutions which can be deprived not only and you have a globally SO in and get the global leadership way I will create the.
and  what is your responsibility and ensure that we don't miss out of the yeah I do all the chin that's happening across the water next.
and the last should we come to the budget to it so the what do you propose a clear details of these  with regard to how these numbers are not but  probably just basically what it was was opening up almost four hundred eighty seven but also what if you get a three year so they come within the scope of  in the sixty I believe with this number was almost seven thousand five hundred does but that included almost two thousand four and fifteen hundred for financing and much more so we have three hundred down to a great level in order to insure that we are able to stock something in this financial year and get some things rolling out.
next.
Joseph so so I  so this is what we are projected to the second.
yesterday sent me a message that we should try to get  C. meeting convened in the first week of June so the note is also ready set to look forward to your input and based on that we can  we can decide the next with a match.
what is the phone to pull a I I think   perhaps at some point you will need some policy are from and off  rooms under  illegal provisions but otherwise  yeah you.
something that that can go in all directions and the worldwide experience is not really good with the kind of thought that is being done with the  in the enrollment.
I think that is something that  which would take either policy on a national policy on the admin approval of the cabinet all right  I'm kind of hope  who's under the I. D. act so that it becomes the.
I mean  so  legally for human.
I think would be a much better because policy I don't think at this moment this request was already a strategy paper is being on would be played by V. D. I. O. they back in two thousand eighteen so I think would be a much.
better options.
name.
another discussion that was actually not  wonder from  notification they need that that one was  it popped up for discussion if I remember correctly and after that  I don't know but that they have come out within the.
and under any policy or something the notification is not dead but they finalized and published.
yes  we  it came up at the drop of a discussion paper and I think June day finalized because they had received the comment that finalized and that that is what the strategy document  after that we all have been using that.
but  that do that think only  I don't know what that that is impossible and  that is only but I have some kind of guideline    yeah it comes and  the man and maybe the  relevent  a ministry so we need to I think the lead and they put that if someone asked me policy are  is that maybe is the appropriate ministry to notify that.
anyway that is not the me  the thing about that is that is to be discussed and  taken forward so that it becomes especially when we're dealing with a possible A. I. and then  if you see the worldwide expedience the  I mean it can go in all directions and there are many ethical questions being raised  on  what kind of research is being done  in the domain up yet so no those when  I also  right at some point in the address so we need to ensure that  we are able to  really  I. D. to cut into the response will  and if you can  yeah he up and what.
anyway that is one that's .
name all for that  social impact and that can be changed that is   something that would actually  can be a better meeting and intend to Brandon data part.
I don't know a budget that also I think whatever one somebody to put down so I did want to  I. M. D.  all the all right what is your status.
let's see if it would be.
I Chow okay so I am due process also will take some time and they will need the the thing N. B. A. B. format look up what the I  will get most made yes.
so we have to bury it in the actual at that's the phone man which was August of last year  twenty one twenty one up.
in the I. D. should not take much time off on.
but I believe that is the latest one might not be in the environment and I think it today on that seem on Max and that's.
do you do I think now you pretty then are your format  but I have not done so I've got you in because I know the latest one.
but then I think then that that is fine.
okay.
I V.  this and used to  be  I just been shown to be on  the  what is the is the  W. W. needed approval reported was provided.
yes.
sure it informally but not in the place but I think that we should  we should  we should go with what.
 making circulated to all other ministries because we require the requirement she's also so we get the input so that we are able to approve it into.
and then they would take it but  without going to I. M. D.  about two minutes to my customers and I think that may not be the only.
I receive  pulling the quote on file or  really doing this.
yes it.
any but I think     did we discuss what come up things that  needs to be just a modified.
 moved to find that then  I will.
but I can pull up and well if I don't buy from us.
because it's it's on that also.
in one part but  but what does these  to be taken on file from the country and then it can be moved by M. B. and then after I am the concurrence  if if we can help them the   just get people that need to follow.
just  send it  and    in north and then  let's take it for what I think would be acted like they were taken out of each time up as  in one of the what or maybe  the the follow up well when we were doing because what they're going to move forward we can put a note on the file based on what we discussed today and then  moved B. and  are you being with that office is going to be what it is.
because what.
yeah we can send that but let's say they will respond as you may be ready to come back.
 that  you required in principle approval and I don't have any  issue I've been calling multiple.
with the company  but  I have to can you cover  anybody to defend the fine and  talk to him and find out which  you know that's okay  I will speak informally explaining the background actually to get because and I will hold it.
well because I think  anything else otherwise again the complaint yes  you don't enjoy because I'm west once again  and   program will.
yeah.
okay so they can close now I think.
thank.
the pilot you.
